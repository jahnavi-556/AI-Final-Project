# Final Project
## Comparison of Tic-tac-toe Game with Minmax algorithm and Q-Learning Algorithm
### Introduction

*	Tic-tac-toe also known as noughts and crosses or X’s and O’s is a two players game in which player can choose either X or O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
* Tic-Tac-Toe game is written in Python and pyGame. You can play versus the computer.
*	We implement tic-tac-toe by using both Minmax and Q-learning Algorithms.

### Goal of the project
*	The main goal of the project is to compare the tic tac toe game using 2 algorithms
Minmax Algorithm and Q-learning Algorithm
*	By evaluating both the algorithms considering the complexity of code and time taken to complete as the key factors. Finally, we will select the best Algorithm to implement the tic tac toe game
